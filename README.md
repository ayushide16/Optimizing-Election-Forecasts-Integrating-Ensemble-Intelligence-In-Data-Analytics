# Optimizing-Election-Forecasts-Integrating-Ensemble-Intelligence-In-Data-Analytics

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance the accuracy of election forecasts by leveraging social media sentiment analysis. By analyzing public sentiment on Twitter, we aim to predict election outcomes for key nations such as Canada, the United States, and India. The project employs various machine learning models and ensemble techniques to create a robust predictive framework.

## Objectives
<ol>
  <li>Improve Election Forecasting Accuracy: Enhance the accuracy of traditional election forecasting methods by incorporating social media sentiment analysis.</li>
  <li>Machine Learning Framework: Develop a machine learning framework that predicts election results based on sentiment analysis of tweets.</li>
  <li>Understand Public Sentiment: Gain insights into the link between public sentiment on social media and actual election results.</li>
</ol>

## Key Features
<ol>
  <li>Data Collection: Tweets related to the Indian elections collected between December 2018 and March 2019.</li>
  <li>Sentiment Analysis: Use Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze the sentiment of tweets.</li>
  <li>Feature Extraction: Extract features such as polarity, subjectivity, POS tags, and TF-IDF values.</li>
  <li>Model Development: Employ machine learning models including Logistic Regression, Na√Øve Bayes, and Support Vector Machine (SVM).</li>
  <li>Ensemble Techniques: Combine predictions from multiple models to improve overall accuracy.</li>
  <li>Hypothesis Testing: Consider the impact of negative sentiments against one party as positive sentiments for the opposition.</li>
</ol>
